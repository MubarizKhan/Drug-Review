Sentiment Analysis on Drug Reviews Using Natural Language Processing
Project Overview

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on drug reviews using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal is to analyze user sentiments from the reviews to understand patient satisfaction and identify patterns in feedback for various medications.
Dataset

    Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Drug Review Dataset
    Description: The dataset contains user reviews on various drugs along with ratings, conditions, and a binary sentiment (positive/negative).

Key Components
Data Preprocessing

    Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK
    Steps:
        Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop words removal)
        Tokenization
        TF-IDF vectorization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Visualization:
        Descriptive statistics
        Sentiment distribution
        Word clouds

Machine Learning Implementation

    Algorithms:
